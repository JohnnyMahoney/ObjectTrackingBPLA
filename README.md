# ObjectTrackingBPLA

This project thoroughly examines the autonomous object navigation system for UAVs using Computer Vision technologies. Existing technological solutions were analyzed, the best of them were selected, and software and hardware components were developed and integrated. The system was then tested. As a result, a software module and a demonstration interface were created, allowing convenient management and configuration of the object tracking system. The interface is intuitive, and the use of the CSRT algorithm ensures high accuracy and reliability in navigation. Future improvements to the system are planned to handle emergency states, buffer images, and enhance overall reliability and efficiency. Key words: autonomous navigation, UAV, Computer Vision, object tracking, CSRT.
